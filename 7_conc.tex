\section{Discussions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

From the analysis of the commutativity of reducers in \cite{XZZ+14}, the commutativity of a reducer in a sequential composition of map-reduce jobs may depend on some implicit data properties guaranteed by the preceding map-reduce jobs. Therefore, to analyze the commutativity of a reducer in a sequential composition of map-reduce jobs, we may need model both mappers and reducers and do a backward analysis.

%Compare SNT with register automata, cost register automata, parameterized counter automata, integer VASS, streamming transducers

%restate the contribution of our work. (1) hint for verifiable reducer/list manipulating program language (2) SNT is a first autoamta with infinite alphabet supporting presburgh arithemetic over input and variables.
