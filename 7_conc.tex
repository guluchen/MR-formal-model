\section{Discussions}

From the analysis of the commutativity of reducers in \cite{XZZ+14}, the commutativity of a reducer in a sequential composition oa map-reduce jobs may depend on some implicit data properties guaranteed by the preceding map-reduce jobs. Therefore, to analyze the commutativity of a reducer in a sequential composition of map-reduce jobs, we may need model both mappers and reducers and do a backward analysis.
